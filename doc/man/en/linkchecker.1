.UNINDENT
.SH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
.sp
LinkChecker accepts Python regular expressions. See
\fI\%https://docs.python.org/howto/regex.html\fP for an introduction.
An addition is that a leading exclamation mark negates the regular
expression.
.SH COOKIE FILES
.sp
A cookie file contains standard HTTP header (RFC 2616) data with the
following possible names:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBHost\fP (required)
Sets the domain the cookies are valid for.
.TP
\fBPath\fP (optional)
Gives the path the cookies are value for; default path is \fB/\fP\&.
.TP
\fBSet\-cookie\fP (required)
Set cookie name/value. Can be given more than once.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Multiple entries are separated by a blank line. The example below will
send two cookies to all URLs starting with \fBhttp://example.com/hello/\fP
and one to all URLs starting with \fBhttps://example.org/\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Host: example.com
Path: /hello
Set\-cookie: ID=\(dqsmee\(dq
Set\-cookie: spam=\(dqegg\(dq
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH PROXY SUPPORT
.sp
To use a proxy on Unix or Windows set the \fI\%http_proxy\fP or
\fI\%https_proxy\fP environment variables to the proxy URL. The URL should be
of the form
\fBhttp://\fP[\fIuser\fP\fB:\fP\fIpass\fP\fB@\fP]\fIhost\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP].
LinkChecker also detects manual proxy settings of Internet Explorer
under Windows systems. On a Mac use
the Internet Config to select a proxy.
You can also set a comma\-separated domain list in the \fI\%no_proxy\fP
environment variable to ignore any proxy settings for these domains.
The \fI\%curl_ca_bundle\fP environment variable can be used to identify an
alternative certificate bundle to be used with an HTTPS proxy.
.sp
Setting a HTTP proxy on Unix for example looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ export http_proxy=\(dqhttp://proxy.example.com:8080\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Proxy authentication is also supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ export http_proxy=\(dqhttp://user1:mypass@proxy.example.org:8081\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Setting a proxy on the Windows command prompt:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
C:\e> set http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH PERFORMED CHECKS
.sp
All URLs have to pass a preliminary syntax test. Minor quoting mistakes
will issue a warning, all other invalid syntax issues are errors. After
the syntax check passes, the URL is queued for connection checking. All
connection check types are described below.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
HTTP links (\fBhttp:\fP, \fBhttps:\fP)
After connecting to the given HTTP server the given path or query is
requested. All redirections are followed, and if user/password is
given it will be used as authorization when necessary. All final
HTTP status codes other than 2xx are errors.
.sp
HTML page contents are checked for recursion.
.TP
Local files (\fBfile:\fP)
A regular, readable file that can be opened is valid. A readable
directory is also valid. All other files, for example device files,
unreadable or non\-existing files are errors.
.sp
HTML or other parseable file contents are checked for recursion.
.TP
Mail links (\fBmailto:\fP)
A mailto: link eventually resolves to a list of email addresses.
If one address fails, the whole list will fail. For each mail
address we check the following things:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
Check the address syntax, both the parts before and after the
@ sign.
.IP 2. 3
Look up the MX DNS records. If we found no MX record, print an
error.
.IP 3. 3
Check if one of the mail hosts accept an SMTP connection. Check
hosts with higher priority first. If no host accepts SMTP, we
print a warning.
.IP 4. 3
Try to verify the address with the VRFY command. If we got an
answer, print the verified address as an info.
.UNINDENT
.TP
FTP links (\fBftp:\fP)
For FTP links we do:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
connect to the specified host
.IP 2. 3
try to login with the given user and password. The default user
is \fBanonymous\fP, the default password is \fBanonymous@\fP\&.
.IP 3. 3
try to change to the given directory
.IP 4. 3
list the file with the NLST command
.UNINDENT
.TP
Unsupported links (\fBjavascript:\fP, etc.)
An unsupported link will only print a warning. No further checking
will be made.
.sp
The complete list of recognized, but unsupported links can be found
in the
\fI\%linkcheck/checker/unknownurl.py\fP
source file. The most prominent of them should be JavaScript links.
.UNINDENT
.SH SITEMAPS
.sp
Sitemaps are parsed for links to check and can be detected either from a
sitemap entry in a robots.txt, or when passed as a \fI\%FILE\-OR\-URL\fP
argument in which case detection requires the urlset/sitemapindex tag to be
within the first 70 characters of the sitemap.
Compressed sitemap files are not supported.
.SH PLUGINS
.sp
There are two plugin types: connection and content plugins. Connection
plugins are run after a successful connection to the URL host. Content
plugins are run if the URL type has content (mailto: URLs have no
content for example) and if the check is not forbidden (ie. by HTTP
robots.txt).
Use the option \fI\%\-\-list\-plugins\fP for a list of plugins and their
documentation. All plugins are enabled via the \fBlinkcheckerrc(5)\fP
configuration file.
.SH RECURSION
.sp
Before descending recursively into a URL, it has to fulfill several
conditions. They are checked in this order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
A URL must be valid.
.IP 2. 3
A URL must be parseable. This currently includes HTML files, Opera
bookmarks files, and directories. If a file type cannot be determined
(for example it does not have a common HTML file extension, and the
content does not look like HTML), it is assumed to be non\-parseable.
.IP 3. 3
The URL content must be retrievable. This is usually the case except
for example mailto: or unknown URL types.
.IP 4. 3
The maximum recursion level must not be exceeded. It is configured
with the \fI\%\-\-recursion\-level\fP option and is unlimited per default.
.IP 5. 3
It must not match the ignored URL list. This is controlled with the
\fI\%\-\-ignore\-url\fP option.
.IP 6. 3
The Robots Exclusion Protocol must allow links in the URL to be
followed recursively. This is checked by searching for a \(dqnofollow\(dq
directive in the HTML header data.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the directory recursion reads all files in that directory, not
just a subset like \fBindex.htm\fP\&.
.SH NOTES
.sp
URLs on the commandline starting with \fBftp.\fP are treated like
\fBftp://ftp.\fP, URLs starting with \fBwww.\fP are treated like
\fBhttp://www.\fP\&. You can also give local files as arguments.
If you have your system configured to automatically establish a
connection to the internet (e.g. with diald), it will connect when
checking links not pointing to your local host. Use the \fI\%\-\-ignore\-url\fP
option to prevent this.
.sp
Javascript links are not supported.
.sp
If your platform does not support threading, LinkChecker disables it
automatically.
.sp
You can supply multiple user/password pairs in a configuration file.
.SH ENVIRONMENT

.SH RETURN VALUE
.sp
The return value is 2 when
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a program error occurred.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The return value is 1 when
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
invalid links were found or
.IP \(bu 2
link warnings were found and warnings are enabled
.UNINDENT
.sp
Else the return value is zero.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.sp
LinkChecker consumes memory for each queued URL to check. With thousands
of queued URLs the amount of consumed memory can become quite large.
This might slow down the program or even the whole system.
