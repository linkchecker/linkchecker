permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

Changes
-------

The Code of Conduct was modified to refer to *project maintainers*
instead of *project team* and small paragraph was added to refer to
the Django enforcement manual.

> Note: We have so far determined that writing an explicit enforcement
> policy is not necessary, considering the available literature
> already available online and the relatively small size of the
> community. This may change in the future if the community grows
> larger.
